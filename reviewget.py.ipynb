The only catch is that you have to order at least 5 pounds.  Is that really a catch though, more like a forced bonus!\\\\n\\\\nI placed the order a few weeks ahead of time, paid my non-refundable deposit and showed up following their detailed (and helpful) instructions and picked up my 5 pounds, 2 links, and bourbon banana cream pie.  It was glorious!\\\\n\\\\nI would not get the banana pie again.  It was too sweet for my taste and a little much for me to take down on my own, but it was highly recommended in reviews on yelp so I decided to try it.  Why not?  I was on vacation.\\\\n\\\\nThe brisket was the best I tasted in austin and I also went to la barbecue, stiles and switch, freedmans, and maybe one more that I\\'m forgetting at the moment.  The pork ribs were also the best that I had in Austin.  I\\'m not sure I would wait 2 hours to get this over another one of the great bbq places in Austin, but I didn\\'t have to worry about waiting.  Well....... I actually did have to wait a little bit for them to cut up the order, but that was also a bonus.  They had free glass bottled coke and big red and bottled water to drink while you wait.  Yes, FREE.  That was awesome and sort of blew me away\\\\n\\\\nSausage is usually pretty far down on my list of bbq options, my list is roughly, brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, beef ribs, something else, then chicken and sausage down at the bottom.\\\\n\\\\nI got 2 sausage just to try since I was on vacation and blowing money on food (i\\'m usually pretty conservative about spending big bucks on food) and they were amazing. I can only describe them as super meaty and solid and the skin had a nice snap to it.  I found a new appreciation for bbq sausage.  Still not above brisket and ribs, but this was top notch sausage in my opinion.\\\\n\\\\nThe service was nice and friendly and the other employees I encountered were friendly.\\\\n\\\\nRead other review about waiting in line as they are informative with good tips.  Try Franklins, waiting in line can be a cool experience from what I read. Plus the line wasn\\'t that long when I got there.

Very very fatty. We ordered too much, and had leftovers for days.\\\\nPork ribs: Very very very tender. The meat came off the bone before we unwrapped it from it\\'s paper cocoon. Too soft for me as far as ribs are concerned. I think the meat should still be on the bone.\\\\nSausage: Mild and tasty.\\\\nSauce: Very good.

So, I will answer some FAQs below.\\\\n\\\\nTo give a frame of reference, I visited in a party of 4 on a Saturday morning, the Saturday before UT started school.\\\\n\\\\nWhen should I go?\\\\nFranklin opens at 11 am. I personally arrived at about 8 am and got to the counter to order my food by 11:30 am. I would suggest arriving at least before 8:30 am in order to get in line AND be in the shade for the entirety of your wait (unless you bring an umbrella/parasol like some late-comers did). \\\\n\\\\nDo you really just stand in line for 3.5 hours?\\\\nMost people don\\'t actually stand. Many visitors will personally bring their own folding chairs. Some even bring coolers with alcohol or drinks or chips. Another cool perk about going early is there are cheap folding chairs available for free use so my friends just sat in line talking and napping.\\\\n\\\\nWhat if I have to use the restroom?\\\\nThey have restrooms inside that they let you use even before doors officially open. There\\'s also AC inside (so I would definitely go use the restroom even if your bladder feels okay).\\\\n\\\\nWhere do I park?\\\\nThere is a decent amount of street parking on the north and west side of barbecue joint. I had no trouble finding parking.\\\\n\\\\nWhat do I get? (FOOD REVIEW)\\\\n4 college-age guys. 3.5 hours in line. We were hungry. So, we ordered 1.5 lbs of brisket, 8 total ribs, 2 sausage links, and a quart of potato salad. With the order you get jalape\\\\u00f1os, sandwich bread, pickles/onions and sauce. The potato salad was okay, nothing spectacular, but a good side with the barbecue. The sausages were surprisingly good! I typically am not the biggest fan of sausages, but I would definitely get these again. The brisket was ever so slightly too dry and too spicy (too many spices) for my taste although my friends loved it. My personal favorite were the RIBS. You know the ribs are going to be good when you pick up the ribs and the meat literally just falls of the bone because of how tender and juicy the ribs are. Ribs ribs ribs\\\\n\\\\nHow much will I spend?\\\\nOur order was $85 total ($21 per person). We didn\\'t get any alcohol or drinks. \\\\n\\\\nDefinitely not somewhere I would go every week because of the half day time commitment required to eat here, but if you love Texas barbecue, and have a morning to spend in Austin, you know where to go.\", \"author\": \"Jacob R.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 4}, \"datePublished\": \"2016-03-19\", \"description\": \"Food is incredible and centered around having to wait 3-4hrs inline till you get your meal or before they sell out.

The only catch is that you have to order at least 5 pounds.  Is that really a catch though, more like a forced bonus!\\n\\nI placed the order a few weeks ahead of time, paid my non-refundable deposit and showed up following their detailed (and helpful) instructions and picked up my 5 pounds, 2 links, and bourbon banana cream pie.

Yes, FREE.  That was awesome and sort of blew me away\\n\\nSausage is usually pretty far down on my list of bbq options, my list is roughly, brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, beef ribs, something else, then chicken and sausage down at the bottom.\\n\\nI got 2 sausage just to try since I was on vacation and blowing money on food (i'm usually pretty conservative about spending big bucks on food) and they were amazing. I can only describe them as super meaty and solid and the skin had a nice snap to it.  I found a new appreciation for bbq sausage.  Still not above brisket and ribs, but this was top notch sausage in my opinion.\\n\\nThe service was nice and friendly and the other employees I encountered were friendly.\\n\\nRead other review about waiting in line as they are informative with good tips.

So, I will answer some FAQs below.\\n\\nTo give a frame of reference, I visited in a party of 4 on a Saturday morning, the Saturday before UT started school.\\n\\nWhen should I go?\\nFranklin opens at 11 am. I personally arrived at about 8 am and got to the counter to order my food by 11:30 am. I would suggest arriving at least before 8:30 am in order to get in line AND be in the shade for the entirety of your wait (unless you bring an umbrella/parasol like some late-comers did). \\n\\nDo you really just stand in line for 3.5 hours?\\nMost people don't actually stand. Many visitors will personally bring their own folding chairs. Some even bring coolers with alcohol or drinks or chips. Another cool perk about going early is there are cheap folding chairs available for free use so my friends just sat in line talking and napping.\\n\\nWhat if I have to use the restroom?\\nThey have restrooms inside that they let you use even before doors officially open. There's also AC inside (so I would definitely go use the restroom even if your bladder feels okay).\\n\\nWhere do I park?\\nThere is a decent amount of street parking on the north and west side of barbecue joint. I had no trouble finding parking.\\n\\nWhat do I get? (FOOD REVIEW)\\n4 college-age guys. 3.5 hours in line. We were hungry. So, we ordered 1.5 lbs of brisket, 8 total ribs, 2 sausage links, and a quart of potato salad. With the order you get jalape\\u00f1os, sandwich bread, pickles/onions and sauce. The potato salad was okay, nothing spectacular, but a good side with the barbecue. The sausages were surprisingly good! I typically am not the biggest fan of sausages, but I would definitely get these again. The brisket was ever so slightly too dry and too spicy (too many spices) for my taste although my friends loved it. My personal favorite were the RIBS. You know the ribs are going to be good when you pick up the ribs and the meat literally just falls of the bone because of how tender and juicy the ribs are. Ribs ribs ribs\\n\\nHow much will I spend?\\nOur order was $85 total ($21 per person). We didn't get any alcohol or drinks. \\n\\nDefinitely not somewhere I would go every week because of the half day time commitment required to eat here, but if you love Texas barbecue, and have a morning to spend in Austin, you know where to go.\", \"author\": \"Jacob R.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 4}, \"datePublished\": \"2016-03-19\", \"description\": \"Food is incredible and centered around having to wait 3-4hrs inline till you get your meal or before they sell out.

Arrived around 9:30a and had lunch at 1:30\\nService (3 Stars) - Counter service and wooden table w paper cut as plates.\\n \\nJimmy's Hacks - Ask for the burnt ends!

The wait honestly didn't feel that long because we knew we could count down until 11am instead of waiting for an unknown period of time.\\n- Loaner chairs are under the staircase next to the deck. \\n- There will be a person walking around taking your 'order' just to make sure they have enough food. By no means do you have to commit to that order.\\n- If you're traveling, you can get a 'packed' 5lb brisket to-go (I believe it's vacuum sealed). You don't have to wait in line! Not sure if it tastes the same, though.\\n\\nIs the wait long? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Like I said, if you line up early enough, you're almost guaranteed to be eating by 11am.

Oh, right, and they'll let you sample it beforehand, too. \\n- Us 3 ladies shared 1.5 lbs of brisket and it was more than enough combined with the other stuff we got.\\n\\nOther meats:\\nSausage is delicious, but we liked Black's BBQ's sausage better.\\nRibs were definitely worth trying. \\nTipsy Texan Sandwich is also a must - it's pretty much impossible to eat like an actual sandwich, so we just busted it open with a knife and had at the sausage, brisket, coleslaw, and pickles with our fork. \\n\\nPLEASE DON'T FORGET TO GET THE BANANA BOURBON PIE!\\nIt's more like a baby tart, but it was so welcome after the meat.

Might just order them to complete the meal.  \\n\\nThe line was 5 hours long.  No regrets\",\n",

       "   'description': 'Wow, what to say about Franklins....\\n\\nIf you are in it to eat \"The Best BBQ in America\" and have a cool story about standing in line for 4 hours to make it more interesting, this is the place to go. There are a couple of other places in Austin where you can get comparable meat with half the wait and even those places are not worth their wait IMHO.. I\\'m happy to have the story to tell, but I wouldn\\'t do it again. It\\'s a one and done experience for sure.\\n\\nOnto the meat. \\nWe got:\\nBrisket: If you don\\'t specify, they will give you half lean, half fatty. Both are super tender and juicy. Very very fatty. We ordered too much, and had leftovers for days.\\nPork ribs: Very very very tender. The meat came off the bone before we unwrapped it from it\\'s paper cocoon. Too soft for me as far as ribs are concerned. I think the meat should still be on the bone.\\nSausage: Mild and tasty.\\nSauce: Very good. Again, very mild.\\n\\nOverall, the meat was too soft for me. Maybe I like a little more chew to my meat, and I\\'m in the lower percentage of folks that like that. If you wait, they will sell you beer in line so that should soften the blow a bit. \\n\\nAll in all, I\\'m happy I got the experience.',\n",

       "   'description': 'Please don\\'t shoot the messenger, I know Franklin\\'s is a staple of Austin, but it wasn\\'t \"life changing.\" As everyone else has said, the waiting part is fun because you can bring drinks, relax, and just hang out with good people. Although the wait is of a couple of hours, it really doesn\\'t feel terrible if you go on a day that doesn\\'t have extreme weather and you bring along some good friends. \\n\\nThere are chairs available for people to sit in if you forget yours, but they\\'re typically toward the front of the line so it\\'s best if you just bring your own. \\n\\nNow, for the food -- which is honestly what everyone is thinking about when they come to Franklin\\'s. The brisket is honest to goodness the best brisket I have tried, so I guess that part of the experience was \"life changing.\" I wish I could\\'ve gone back for more about 8 more times because it was that good. We got the fattier part of the brisket, which just had so much flavor and tasted so delicious. \\n\\nHowever, I\\'m more of a ribs person so I was hoping to find that the ribs would be equally as incredible. They weren\\'t. I didn\\'t like the rub that as used on the ribs--it was too peppery and too strong. I felt that the majority of the taste of the ribs was only in the rub and since the rub wasn\\'t my favorite, it ruined the taste of the ribs for me. \\n\\nThe dessert pies are also a nice touch at the end of a good meal, but honestly you probably don\\'t even need them. You\\'ll be good with the meat that you\\'ve ordered. \\n\\nDefinitely recommend Franklin\\'s for the brisket, but don\\'t do the line if you\\'re just looking for good ribs.',\n",

       "   'description': \"Alright, so you're probably looking on Yelp because your friend suggested visiting Franklin for lunch and, being the more responsible friend, you decide to look on Yelp to figure out some of the logistical details involving visiting the best barbecue place in Austin (and in Texas if I might be so bold). So, I will answer some FAQs below.\\n\\nTo give a frame of reference, I visited in a party of 4 on a Saturday morning, the Saturday before UT started school.\\n\\nWhen should I go?\\nFranklin opens at 11 am. I personally arrived at about 8 am and got to the counter to order my food by 11:30 am. I would suggest arriving at least before 8:30 am in order to get in line AND be in the shade for the entirety of your wait (unless you bring an umbrella/parasol like some late-comers did). \\n\\nDo you really just stand in line for 3.5 hours?\\nMost people don't actually stand. Many visitors will personally bring their own folding chairs. Some even bring coolers with alcohol or drinks or chips. Another cool perk about going early is there are cheap folding chairs available for free use so my friends just sat in line talking and napping.\\n\\nWhat if I have to use the restroom?\\nThey have restrooms inside that they let you use even before doors officially open. There's also AC inside (so I would definitely go use the restroom even if your bladder feels okay).\\n\\nWhere do I park?\\nThere is a decent amount of street parking on the north and west side of barbecue joint. I had no trouble finding parking.\\n\\nWhat do I get? (FOOD REVIEW)\\n4 college-age guys. 3.5 hours in line. We were hungry. So, we ordered 1.5 lbs of brisket, 8 total ribs, 2 sausage links, and a quart of potato salad. With the order you get jalapeños, sandwich bread, pickles/onions and sauce. The potato salad was okay, nothing spectacular, but a good side with the barbecue. The sausages were surprisingly good! I typically am not the biggest fan of sausages, but I would definitely get these again. The brisket was ever so slightly too dry and too spicy (too many spices) for my taste although my friends loved it. My personal favorite were the RIBS. You know the ribs are going to be good when you pick up the ribs and the meat literally just falls of the bone because of how tender and juicy the ribs are. Ribs ribs ribs\\n\\nHow much will I spend?\\nOur order was $85 total ($21 per person). We didn't get any alcohol or drinks. \\n\\nDefinitely not somewhere I would go every week because of the half day time commitment required to eat here, but if you love Texas barbecue, and have a morning to spend in Austin, you know where to go.\",\n",

The owners are incredibly nice, they come out and check up on you frequently. There's also a coffee and taco place near by that you can grab breakfast while you wait. I highly recommend grabbing lawn chairs, coffee, games, and good friends to help through the wait time. As far as the food? Delicious, only in Texas can you get something of this caliber. Love the beef brisket with the soft white bread. Their bourbon pie is also really tasty.

       "   'description': \"SURVIVOR'S GUIDE TO FRANKLIN BBQ:\\n\\n- Go on an off-day if you can help it. We went on a Tuesday. It's closed on Mondays.\\n- Lining up way before it opens (11am) to snag a spot early. We lined up at 8:45am, waited until it opened, and ordered by 11:15am. The wait honestly didn't feel that long because we knew we could count down until 11am instead of waiting for an unknown period of time.\\n- Loaner chairs are under the staircase next to the deck. \\n- There will be a person walking around taking your 'order' just to make sure they have enough food. By no means do you have to commit to that order.\\n- If you're traveling, you can get a 'packed' 5lb brisket to-go (I believe it's vacuum sealed). You don't have to wait in line! Not sure if it tastes the same, though.\\n\\nIs the wait long? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Like I said, if you line up early enough, you're almost guaranteed to be eating by 11am. We waited 2 hours at la Barbecue the day before so it's not like other popular BBQ spots in the city lack significant waits.\\n\\nOh right,\\nTHE FOOD:\\n\\nBRISKET!\\nBRISKET!\\nBRISKET!\\nBRISKET!\\nWe went to la Barbecue and drove down to Lockhart for Black's BBQ and, despite having eaten a 700 lbs of meat within the last two days, agreed Franklin's brisket is the best. The brisket is fatty on the inside and smokey on the outside. \\n\\nBrisket tips: \\n- You can get both fatty and 'leaner'. We opted for a mix of both. Oh, right, and they'll let you sample it beforehand, too. \\n- Us 3 ladies shared 1.5 lbs of brisket and it was more than enough combined with the other stuff we got.\\n\\nOther meats:\\nSausage is delicious, but we liked Black's BBQ's sausage better.\\nRibs were definitely worth trying. \\nTipsy Texan Sandwich is also a must - it's pretty much impossible to eat like an actual sandwich, so we just busted it open with a knife and had at the sausage, brisket, coleslaw, and pickles with our fork. \\n\\nPLEASE DON'T FORGET TO GET THE BANANA BOURBON PIE!\\nIt's more like a baby tart, but it was so welcome after the meat. Heavy on the bourbon, thank you very much.\",\n",

This didn't deter me- I was dead set on getting this BBQ. They actually provide chairs, umbrellas to block the sun, water, and even came around with small pork sandwiches to tide us over. \\n\\nAs I got towards the front I got to take in the atmosphere- and I loved it! Very old school place and achieves that perfect balance of being cozy/rustic but not dingy. I have to say as a first timer, the long wait kind of enhanced the experience a bit for me.... kind of like stepping onto a roller coaster after a long line. The guys at the counter were super nice to everyone, asking where they were from and offering free samples. \\n\\nTHE FOOD- I tried the ribs, brisket, and sausage. All 3 were some of the most incredible meat I've ever had. The brisket practically melts in your mouth. They all had a delicious and smokey flavor like i've never had before. Washed down with a delicious locally brewed beer- I was literally in heaven.\\n\\nStepping away from the romantic view of my first trip here- I can see how the line can be a major annoyance if you're a local or just want a quick bite to eat. It also is a bit pricey. But just speaking for me- it was absolutely worth every penny and the long wait. I look forward to coming back here again at some point in life.\",\n",

I love BBQ and I'm not afraid to travel for it. The best thing about this place is if you live in Austin, you no longer have to go further than 900 E 11th St to get the best BBQ anywhere. I judge BBQ places by their Brisket and this is the best brisket I have ever eaten. We had ribs, sausage, pulled pork, and turkey as well. All easily some of the best I can recall. The turkey was outstanding (whole turkey breast, not smoked deli meat turkey like most BBQ places). It was super moist, perfectly smoked, and the biggest surprise of the trip. All that being said, I didn't come here to eat turkey! I would say the Pulled Pork, though very good, did not stand out as insanely good like brisket did. Definitely worth a try though, but if you're like me and live in search of the perfect brisket, your search ends at 900 E. 11th. Now for the wait that everyone talks about.....it is real. We got there at 10 am (they open at 11) and were 30 people back in line. By the time the doors opened at 11, there were easily 100 people in line (it was a Saturday). it took us 40 minutes to get through the line and get seated. You gotta want it if you are going to eat here, but I'm telling you,it's worth all the trouble. There were several people that brought a few beers from home (yours truly included) to sip on while waiting. Didn't seem to be an issue so if that's your kind of thing, go for it. They do sell beer inside (Live Oak on tap and shiner and few others in cans). Can't tell you anything about the sides other than I consider them a complete waste of space when BBQ like they have is on the menu. Sauces were all good, though nothing really needed sauce. The Espresso sauce was awesome on the Brisket and the lighter red vinegar sauce was delicious on the sausage, ribs and pork. Lastly, a little note about Brisket: get the moist or fatty cut. The lean is fine, I'm sure, but if you are after the ethereal, perfect cut of brisket, get the fatty cut and plan for a nap after.\"}, {'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 5}, 'author': 'Lam M.', 'datePublished': '2011-03-02', 'description': 'I got there late.

We got in line about 10:05, and were maybe 6th or 7th in line. We had a few more pop in front of us with their friends, but not that many. We got in and were seated fairly quickly around 11:15. The brisket is just about the best you can get anywhere. The pork ribs are right behind, and have about the perfect amount of flavor and tenderness. I tried the sausage for the first time, and it was above average, with a nice amount of meat-to-grease ratio. Sometimes you get sausage from places that have pockets of grease where the fat renders down. His is not like that, and is a nice solid link. We did see the new smoker he has gotten. It is the typical propane tank design, except it is about double the size of his other two round smokers. I'm guessing it is a 1000 gallon model. He indicated it will hold 30+ briskets by itself, so if he is able to dial it in the same as his other ones, we should have a lot more overall BBQ cooked each day, and he might even be open past lunch hour.\"}, {'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 5}, 'author': 'Chance R.', 'datePublished': '2010-05-06', 'description': 'In the pantheon of trailer eateries that is Austin, Franklin\\'s is by far Zeus.  There should be a picture of this place next to the definition of what the ideal trailer eatery is.  This intense statement is not strictly based on the food (which is amazing btw), but all around atmosphere and the insane level of friendliness from the owners and the people who work here. My personal favorite is the pulled pork. It is incredibly tender and juicy.  I\\'m by no means a BBQ purist because I think sauce is a staple and Franklin\\'s has an array of sauces.  The pork bbq sauce is perfectly tangy to where your salivary glands go into overdrive the second you put in your mouth.  Their most talked about sauce is their espresso BBQ sauce, which is definitely original, is rich, thick, with the slightest bit of espresso bitterness at the finish. (I hope that description doesn\\'t make me sound like usual pretentious \"I think I\\'m a food critic\" guy). The lunch line to this place is always wrapped around the corner, I\\'ve never been here without a wait.  On more than one occasion while waiting they have offered us a small sample of meat they were cutting at the moment.  You can tell that owner Aaron and his wife have a true passion for what they do.  Besides creating probably the best BBQ I have had here in Austin they do it while being as real, personable, and friendly as you can imagine. As I previously said, this is the ideal trailer for grub.......also the bourbon banana pudding is AMAZING'}], 'name': 'Franklin Barbecue', 'image': 'https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hw9QWXsRkMiXaRW9PAtQNQ/ls.jpg', 'telephone': '+15126531187', '@type': 'Restaurant', 'priceRange': '$11-30', '@context': 'http://schema.org/'}\n"

Luckily the restaurant provides foldable chairs on a first come, first serve basis and there were plenty still available when we got there. The restaurant also sells cans of local craft beer that you can enjoy while you wait in line (or you can bring your own). The restaurant finally opened at 11am but it wasn't until an hour later we were actually able to sit down and enjoy the food. This was the longest amount of time I have ever waited in line for food and it was completely worth it! The hype surrounding Franklin Barbecue is for real! First you have to get the Brisket. This is their signature meat for a reason. The meat is soft as butter, super juicy, literally melts in your mouth, and has a flavorful peppery seasoned crust on the outside. I would have been perfectly happy if the Brisket was the only thing I ate after the four-hour wait but the Ribs were also some of the best I have ever had. The Ribs were tender, fell off the bone, and full of flavor. The Sausage was also really good and filled with flavorful spices. We also had some Pulled Pork which was decent but mostly untouched since we filled up on all the other meats. We also had a side of Potato Salad that added a nice carb and creamy break to all the meat and an appetizing Pecan Pie, which added a nice sweetness and crunch to end our very filling meal. Overall, this was the best barbecue I have ever had and I would be willing to wait in line again for this delicious food.\", \"author\": \"Nicolas L.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 5}, \"datePublished\": \"2016-02-09\", \"description\": \"This is the best bbq i've ever had! I never say that about anything. I always have to find something about a place because \\\"best i've ever had\\\" sounds so extreme. But it's true in this case. A lot of people agree too. 4 hours of wait in line worth of people. But it was worth it. I got in line at 9am and we ended up ordering and eating around 1230pm. The place is BYOB so you can drink in line if you want to. It also helps to take shifts. They provide some lawn chairs, but if you get there after 9am usually they're all already taken. There is a coffee food truck right next door. On Sundays the coffee food truck (Legends) runs out of scones pretty quickly, but it's convenient. Also there is a Vintage Heart Coffee Shop within walking distance. \\n\\nFood wise -- Definitely order the lean brisket! The fatty brisket is also amazing. We also tried the sausage, turkey, pulled pork. All of it is amazing. Their sides are actually pretty good also. I would recommend only getting the smallest serving of the sides though, because all the meat is so filling. And I also noticed that it is better to order less than what your stomach says :P But you can always take it to go if you can't finish it.\\n\\nIf you're feeling lazy and not wanting to get in line super early -- just stay home. If you don't get in line by 9am you'll be worried the whole wait that they will run out of brisket by the time you get to the front.

Have fantasized ever since seeing Aaron's appearance in the movie Chef.Finally living in Austin, I had to try. I couldn't sleep the night before, tossed and turned awaiting the moment to wake up to get there silly early to be first, which I was. Arriving at 5:55 I took my spot and powered the kindle for a long morning. 6:25 the first couple came, a great couple visiting from San Francisco. Hour past hour, we compared foods tried, countries visited, our heritages. I honestly think Franklin's is more about the experience than exclusively the food in a vacuum. I got 1lb brisket (half fatty/ half flat with burnt tips), 1lb beef ribs, 1/2 lb Turkey and a link. The link, perfect pop when biting into, highly fatty so beware when you bite in or you will spray your neighbors. The Turkey, was good but is a uniformly pedestrian protein best left to November. The ribs were done perfectly enough to pick up the rib and the meat nearly slides off the bone. Now the brisket. Walking up to order station upon opening, first in the line they cut off the burnt ends presented a tray and instructed to enjoy and share to those behind who have waited the longest. Knee buckle good. Yes, that good. Never a fan of fatty end of brisket but getting because.....Franklin's. Still not hugely a fan as its simply fatty, without much bite. Lean end...perfectly seasoned, amazing smoke ring, cut uniformly 1/4 inch and surviving the pull test. Now for the caveat. Has Aaron Franklin taken the uniformly tough piece of protein and given it the respect to prepare it as perfectly as is possible? Absolutely. Without question. Team members working there, the best, most friendly in Austin without question. Absolutely perfect to be modeled elsewhere in Austin. Food for the price drive though, absolutely. The food for the price in a closet, maybe. The culture that has grown around the tailgating culture of a 3,4,5 hour wait, meeting new friends, enjoying beers and the anticipation similar to kickoff of a ticket holder experiencing Super Bowl, absolutely worth it. Without question. When friends come in to town would I suggest Franklins for the experience/food? Without question.

Consequently, many people like myself needed to get their barbecue fix so the line was longer than I had expected it to be. But to me, waiting in a long line for what has been voted the best barbecue in the nation is part of the experience. \\n\\nGot in line at about 8am and met the others in line (we were going to be next to them for a while so all the more reason to be friendly). After a while, the hostess came out to see what we wanted to order so she could gauge how much food could be guaranteed for all of the people in the line. It being our first time to Franklin's, we asked her opinion on what to order and how much (especially seeing as were going to be on a flight later that evening and didn't want to carry a ton of leftovers onto an airplane). We ended up with 1/4 lb. lean brisket, 1/4 lb. fatty, 1 lb. of pork ribs, 1/2 lb. of pulled pork, 1/2 lb. of turkey, 2 links of sausage, single slaw, single potato salad, single beans, 1 banana bourbon pie.\\n\\nLater, while still in line, it began to really get hot. The employees of Franklin's continually came out to supply those waiting with a large water cooler filled with ice water, cold beers for sale, and umbrellas we could borrow to keep out of the sun. Much appreciated!\\n\\nUltimately, we sat down to eat around 1pm (so a 5hr wait in total). What can I say? The food was delicious! Both the lean and fatty brisket were very moist, ribs were peppery and tender, sausages were slightly spicy (in a good way) and had a great casing snap when you bit into it. The pulled pork was tasty, but not my favorite; I probably wouldn't order it again. The quiet star though was the turkey! VERY moist and peppery, and slightly smokey. The money I put down on the pulled pork I would transfer for more turkey.\\n\\nSides tasted good, but paled in comparison to the main meats. Banana bourbon pie was awesome, that's the one I would recommend.\\n\\nIf it's your first time going to Franklin's, I would recommend sampling everything. If I were to order again, I'd probably get fatty brisket, ribs, sausage, and turkey along with beans and the banana bourbon pie. \\n\\nAs far as cost goes, all of the food previously mentioned in addition to two shirts and two fountain drinks, ran about $110.\", \"author\": \"Jordan B.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 5}, \"datePublished\": \"2017-02-08\", \"description\": \"Not going to lie, best barbecue I've ever had.

Will probably be back... please open a bigger place that is more efficient... seriously.\", \"author\": \"Loan N.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 4}, \"datePublished\": \"2017-01-18\", \"description\": \"We came on a rainy Sunday at 7:30 am and managed to get our food by noon.  Bring some friends, beers and lawn chairs to sit on while you wait out the long line to taste what is supposedly the best barbecue you will ever taste.  If you come early enough there are at least 20-30 lawn chairs available for free use (located in a little nook underneath the outdoor stairwell of the restaurant).   We ended up over-ordering and had plenty of food left over for home.   For two people though, I would recommend 1 lb of brisket and 1 lb of ribs. The sausage was too greasy and not worth trying at all.  I preferred the ribs over the brisket but I think both were very well cooked, perfectly moist and seasoned beautifully.  The potato salad was decent but nothing out of this world.  This is THE barbecue mecca of the world so you have to try it at least once in your life right?  Would I ever put myself through another 3.5 hour wait to eat barbecue again?  Unlikely.  Next time, I'm in Austin though, I will try to plan accordingly and use their online pre-order system to save myself the hassle.\", \"author\": \"Lynda T.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 5}, \"datePublished\": \"2017-05-10\", \"description\": \"The best brisket I have ever had! The wait is definitely part of the experience. We got there at 6 am and were 3rd in line, the guy directly behind us told us he had come before but didn't get to eat here because he arrived too late lol. It was definitely worth the 5 hr wait. The ribs, sausage and beef ribs are really great. BUT the freaking BRISKET!!!! Definitely the way to go. I have never had such tender, juicy brisket. Perfectly seasoned, you don't even need any BBQ sauce. IT'S THAT GOOD! We got 1/2 pound fatty, and 1/2 lean. The line really starts to form around 7am ish, but we went on a Saturday. It maybe better during the week.  They have lawn chairs there for your use, and the coffee shop around the corner opens at 8am. The owner was there, and gave the first person in line a free t-shirt, which i thought was very sweet. Not only will i becoming back, but next time I will try to be 1st in line lol.\", \"author\": \"Andrea R.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 5}, \"datePublished\": \"2016-09-22\", \"description\": \"Brisket is totally worth the wait.

My girlfriend and I came from San Antonio to try this place out for my birthday. I had been looking at Yelp all week and I would see pics of the crazy lines so the last thing I wanted was for us to go and they run out of food. I emailed Franklins and asked what time they thought we should get there, we were going on a Friday morning and it was also the first day of SXSW so I didn't know if that would affect traffic. We left 5am and got there at about 7:15, I was super excited to see there was only 5 people waiting in line. The guy who was first in line had gotten there at 5:45am BRAVO TO YOU SIR!!! I TIP MY HAT TO YOU lol We brought lawn chairs (even though they have a couple there to use) and a cooler of beer. The line didn't start picking up til about 9ish. A lady comes down the line and asks what you wanna order just to get an idea. Unfortunately they only have beef Ribs on Saturday's. They also open up a side door to their bathrooms at about 8 so you can use them during the long wait. The wait went by fast which was awesome!!!! They opened right at 11 and we went right on it. We got 1lb of fatty brisket, half pound of lean, 1 lb of pork ribs and a side of cold slaw and potato salad. The sides were pretty good  but the brisket and ribs were definitely something else. The smoke ring on the brisket was beautiful and every piece had bark on it. Even the lean pieces were super moist (I'm not a fan of lean brisket but my gf is so she's the one that ordered it) but I was even impressed with the lean. The ribs were hands down the star of the show!!!!! The first bone I grabbed the meat just fell off, I mean just melted off LIKE BUTTER!!!! I've tried some awesome BBQ places before but those were hands down some of the best ribs we've had. I would honestly go back and order about 5lbs just for myself LOL overall I would say this place is definitely worth the wait if you go at a descent time. A lot people got there super late so obviously they probably encountered them running out of food. The weekends is what seems to get pretty crazy so I would try a weekday if you can. We were prepared for all forms of weather cuz obviously we live in Texas, we had our jackets, a blanket and even a couple umbrellas in case of rain. Hands down I would say worth the wait, if you can't stand waiting in line for more than hour then don't even try lol we even took some snacks and stuff to munch on while we waited as well \\nFranklins is definitely an experience all on it's own. If you have a day off take the time to load up truck, grab your beer and your dog and go wait in line for some PHENOMENAL BBQ\", \"author\": \"Matt D.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 4}, \"datePublished\": \"2017-05-17\", \"description\": \"Overrated. While the food is legendary, the opportunity cost of eating at this restaurant is way too high. You're bound to wait hours in line full of experience hungry Austinites, and the price of the barbecue is pretty high for what it is. I can't argue with the taste (6 stars if I could), but Franklin's is more of an experience. I can't see myself coming back here often. Definitely other barbecue restaurants at similar quality in Austin (salt lick).\", \"author\": \"Nathan Y.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 5}, \"datePublished\": \"2017-04-27\", \"description\": \"Well guys, finally made it to Franklins. I opted to do the pre-order route which I would highly recommend, given that is was amazing but I'm not waiting in a freaking like for 5 hours. I waited 5 min to get my meat! Had brisket, ribs, sausage - all 5 star. They gave us 3 different sauces but I liked the OG one. If you have big group (or a big cooler), pre-order.

I've lived in Texas almost all my life and have friends that compete in BBQ competitions.  I had Franklin's brisket and it was like I had Never.  Had.  Brisket.  Before.  WOW.
