Just note that a 1/4 lb of snow crab is significantly more food than 1/4 lb of crawfish ;)\n\nArgentinian shrimp: 5/5\nBy far the largest shrimp I've had in a boil. I totally recommend\n\nFries: regular 4/5, sweet potato 5/5\nWe got both regular and sweet potato. If you're into crispy fries, I recommend sweet potato.\n\nCollard greens: 4/5\nDelicious and very well seasoned\n\nSweet tea: 5/5\nI've had sweet tea in bumfuck nowhere Louisiana and this was just as delicious. \n\nOverall, great place, delicious food, solid service.

I ordered the fried catfish basket and the batter was thick and full of oil and over-fried. The catfish did not taste fresh at all and my stomach hurt after just a few bites -- I picked most of the batter off to try to salvage some fish, but was still terribly disappointed. You don't even get very much fish for $12. What you think looks like a decent amount of fish is actually just a tiny bit of fish with very thick, unappetizing batter--not the kind of batter that's actually good that you are sometimes almost ashamed that you would eat it plain. What a waste of money. \n\nFried catfish is pretty difficult to mess up, so I am  highly disappointed. \n\nIt was also quite apparent that the fries had been cooked in old or just bad oil that definitely needed a change.", "author": "Erin H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-03", "description": "This place is soliddd.

It is only open for dinner which is a shame but you will not be disappointed. We sat in the outside back area at a shared table. Looks like most of the tables are shared since they do not have much space.

Very delicious with the right mix of crunchy and creamy in the cheese.\n\nI had to try the original korzo burger and it did not disappoint. Im not even sure what were the toppings on the burger but everything worked together well. If i had one negative it would be that it was a bit oily. Overall it was great.\n\nMy wife got the pulled pork sandwich. It was not your typical pulled pork sandwich from bbq place.

Excellent entree option. \nKorzo burgers look superb, will try one next time around. \nDessert was the cheesecake flan. Mouth watering and such an eccentric design with the Strawberry topping too. Decadent cheesecake texture and flan caramel sauce on top. Superb option for the last course. \nOur service experience is always positive.

The burger was excellent: well seasoned, perfectly cooked and wrapped in a fried dough bun. Along with the string french fries and homemade cole slaw, its a pretty fantastic dish. Seriously, I am running out of adjectives to describe how much I enjoyed it. The Beet Benedikt, overall was a great dish. The combination of poached egg, hollandaise sauce, ham and cornmeal pancake makes an excellent flavor. These should be eaten together, however, because alone, they are not quite as delicious as the sum of there parts. The beets and lettuce are a nice complement, but not necessary to the whole dish.

Sausage, pork belly that tasted more like thick cut Canadian ham drowned in Gouda, saut\u00e9ed onions and nougatine dumplings. It was small in size but boy did it pack a punch. I would've liked some pita or crostini to accompany this as it were a bit salty for my sensitive palate, but at that rate, the appetizer would've sufficiently fed 2 people. \n\nThe Original burger, medium rare, was dressed with pickled relish and applewood bacon and encased in fried dough, not unlike a doughnut. Someone described it like a burger pie. I would say a burger knish or a burger patty. That is their unique spin on reinventing the burger. And BBC deserves praise. Fun, easy to hold and eat. The burger meat was juicy and delicious. I do miss my regular buns though. Maybe 2nd time's the charm. Oh, and their skinny square fries deserve an honorable mention. So good and crispy, we finish every last one with the hot sauce that tasted like tangy salsa with a kick.

Happy to say that I will absolutely be coming back. They have a great menu - lots of options. Although a lot of the foods are on the heavier side, everything my bf and I tried was delicious. \n\nFOOD: They are NOT lying when they say that the Korzo burger is one of THE BEST burgers in NYC. The meat is incredibly juicy! Most interestingly, it is served almost as a pierogie. The dough around it is very soft and light. It compliments the meat and makes the juiciness of the meat the main focus. \nMy bf and I both got \"The Original\" which comes with their beef blend, apple-smoked bacon, Allaguer cheese, house made mustard and a pickle. This all fits within the \"pierogi\". It comes with a choice of fries or salad. They suggest that you order the meat medium rare - which after trying, I highly suggest as well. \nTheres not a doubt in mind I would want to come here instead of my usual burger spots when the craving hits! \n\nWe also got a few appetizers - The \"Turnip Fall Squash Dumplings\" with spicy pulled pork. They reminded me of the Russian \"vareniki\" - which is a dumpling, flat but filled. The pork here was tender and although there were only four served, they're filling. If you like dumplings, definitely get these to try! They're an unusual flavor from the dumplings at Asian places. There is an option to get the dumplings with mushrooms instead of the spicy pork. \n\nWe also got the \"Battered Slovak Edam\" which is fried cheese. It basically reminded me of a very high end mozzarella stick. It comes with tartar sauce which is a very interesting touch to the cheese. It's a fairly large square - definitely a \"comfort food\". Both appetizers came with some beets on the side . \n\nThe service was quick and our waitress was super friendly. The place itself is very small.

It's Wednesday around 6:30pm on the last day of summer. We're a group of 5 and the restaurant is about half full or half empty depending on how well your Zoloft is working today. \n\nWhen we arrived, we noticed that there was 1 server and 1 bartender who both seemed in good spirits. We were seated in the backyard and asked about drinks right away. Now watch out. This review is about to take a drastic turn. \n\nAfter we ordered drinks, we waited. Then we waited some more and after a little more waiting, our drinks came. When the waitress came back, we were way past ready to order. We ordered appetizers and main meals at the same time and yup...this woman did not write one thing down. 3 appetizers and 5 meals with a ton of substitutions and questions in the middle...not one word written. And then we waited again and waited some more. \n\nThe main meal surprisingly came about 15 min after the appetizers and thankfully the food was good and hot. 3 out of 5 of us had been here before so we knew the food was worth it. \n\nAfter 4 of us we're served, we waited for the last person in our party to get their meal. After about 5 minutes, she insisted that we start without her. 20 minutes later, after everyone was on their last few bites and the waitress was nowhere to be found, we were still waiting on the last entree. At this point we were all pissed and one of us got up to find the waitress. She was happily standing around by the opening of the kitchen EATING A PLATE OF FOOD. Ummmm seriously?\n\nSo we angrily told her that we still hadn't  received all of our food. After an unapologetic & annoyed \"sorry\" SHE GOT MAD AT US!!! She asked what was missing (you would have known if you had written it down) and repeated about 10 times...\"What!! I SAID I was sorrrry.\" Ugh. \n\nSo after all of the meals were sent and eaten, I told the waitress that we were celebrating a birthday and to please bring us  a dessert. Though the dessert was on the house, nothing else was. Maybe if that last meal was on the house I wouldn't have complained as much, but the waitress seriously screwed up. \n\nI will be coming here again for the food, but I will be very cautious if I see that woman again.", "author": "Lori K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-19", "description": "This is literally the second time I came here.

Definitely recommend and a well deserved 5 star. I didn't order any drinks because I drove that night but I will try them one day for sure. For appetizers, we had the baked halusky, wunderwurst sausages and the perogies.\n\nThe baked halusky can serve up 3-4 imo. It might smell weird to you cause of the gouda but it is sooo delicious. I haven't had anything like it before and I was hesitant at first from the smell but once I took a bite, I was in heaven!\n\nThe wunderwurst i believe is 3 different sausages cut in halves so it can serve 4-6 if you like to share . The sausages were not dry, it was very juicy and cooked just perfectly. I can't remember how each tasted but I know all three sausages tasted delicious along with the sauces and condiments not comes with. \n\nThe perogies comes with I was wasn't a big fan of because I'm just not a fan of them but it still tasted better than other restaurants I tried it at. Don't have much to say about them.\n\nFor the entree, I ordered the original korzo burger medium rare with fries. My date also ordered an original korzo burger medium rare but with a salad.\n\nNever had a burger that tasted this good. Puts shake shack, in n out, burger bistro, or any burger joint to shame. The deep fried bread makes the burger unique and adds so much flavor to the beef patty. Their homemade beet ketchup makes the burger even more tasty. The fries also good. Not salty at all, not too crispy and definitely not soggy. The fries are better than most fries served at a burger joint imo. The salad was surprisingly tasty. I'm a big guy and I don't like salads but their salad tasted so fresh and refreshing with their minty dressing. Leaves your mouth feeling clean and minty after each bite.\n\nThis place is a small spot so a long wait is expected during dinner hours and weekends but trust me, it is definitely worth the wait.

As always Sandra took my reservation for 5ppl over the phone and we secure a  table for 7pm. I order a bottle of Rioja to start the evening, which was a very good value \"Cepas Antiguas,  Rioja seleccion privada 2015\"\n When they opened the bottle, it had a nice bouquet of plums and berries and since i had already planned my meal, i knew it be a good choice for the evening. I had the homemade ricotta gnocchi with asparagus and mushroom sauce. Perfectly cooked gnocchi, flavorful sauce, silky smooth and well seasoned.  I had a chance to get a bite of the P.A. braised pork belly, wow that pork was spectacular. Nice crunchy skin, with layers of pork goodness and the sauce had a nice level of acidity to accompany the pickles, pork and watercress harmoniously. I mean this is why i have been to casa del chef 2x in the last month. You cannot find farm to table cuisine with such a degree of fineness, execution and \nRefinement unless you go to an overprice stuffy manhattan restaurant. Casa del Chef is perfect for a home style sit down meal without having to worry about wheather your meal will be good or not. Totally worry free option, just sit back and enjoy and yes bring cash, as they no longer take credit cards.\nI digress back to my food, my main course was the pork ossobuco with ginger gastrique. This dish was served on a bed of lentils and collard greens.  One can ask, how much pork can you get in a meal. My answer would be \"Never enough\"  This was a very healthy portion for a main course. Even my wife got to share a little bit of my meal. Our friend was also blown away by the food and she will also become  loyal customer as well. We all had room for dessert, so we order a round of port wine for the table to go along with the warm white chocolate bread pudding which was super yummy. I must confess i never saw the guiness ice cream when i read the menu, but it amazing. The rest of the table had creme brulee, and the Ecuadorian chocolate ice cream. \nIt was a great way to spend a rainy evening with good friends and awesome food.\nThank you Chef Alfonso and Thank you Sandra for making us feel part of the family!", "author": "Daniel M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-12", "description": "I have been twice and I am going to say I was blown away. I am not going to say it was a perfect meal, the apps and the dessert in my Chef's Tasting were just good but both my entrees were excellent. On my second visit, it solidified my belief that the fish dishes here are outstanding, if they offer any kind of pan seared bass or red snapper, you must get it. Also, his menu changes often so make sure to check the website.\n\nThe chef, Alfonso Zhicay, came to America in 1994 from Ecuador and since then has worked at Bouley, Union Pacific and spent ten years working at Blue Hill. He lives in the neighbor of the restaurant, so I appreciate that he opened the restaurant here since he really could have easily opened up anywhere but he decided to put faith in the area he calls home.\n\nThe food:\n\nChef's Tasting July \n\nCucumber Gazpacho- This was refreshing especially with the Summer heat but the flavors didn't really blow me away. It was OK. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wCZ4GQDpgRytZm-Ghsrw7g&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nRed Snapper- This was my favorite dish of the night. It was so perfectly cooked with a nice crispy skin. The portion was on the small side but the flavors were spot on. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oEnt1DDHLrxQiC9EQR8HSA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nPork Chop- The pork chop was super tender and had good flavor, the sauce was tasty but my only issue was the dish came off too sweet. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3GNCdAMKH3MmzGzya_C7yQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nChocolate Mousse with Passion Fruit and Blueberry- It was kinda an odd pairing but it was nice and refreshing for the Summer. I thought the passion fruit and blueberry had too much of an aggressive flavor and kinda overpowered everything else. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wnOkYsodA0iw8dWdiAHjWw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nA la Carte October\n\nAutumn Soup- The Autumn Soup was a bowl of corn soup that was served hot. The broth was really tasty, it had a very deep corn flavor and had a nice sweetness. The corn itself was surprisingly mild in flavor, it was kinda surprising the corn pieces didn't have more flavor. Overall, still a good soup. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0Kt49Jn4S4v4TZv15vUXGA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nGrilled Rainbow Trout- Roasted Cauliflower, capers & olives vinaigrette. Like I said, they know how to do fish here. I really like the Trout dish here. The fish was cooked perfectly and the cauliflower add a nice contrast in texture with vinaigrette tying everything together nicely. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kE_S39P_aJzFcPZRhkjcqw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nPan-Seared Black Bass- Spaghetti squash, potatoes, pumpkin seed pesto. This was the dish of the night, it was spectacular. The fish was perfection and the squash and potatoes paired well with the fish, and I loved the pesto. This is an absolute must order. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_i6ZA_rugfH4HGwCOzJj3w&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nSwordfish- Green tomato marmalade, greens, roasted beet sauce. I thought this dish was OK, the fish was very lightly cooked and the taste of the fish was a bit strong for me and the texture kinda looked and felt like eating raw chicken breast so it wasn't the most appealing. The green tomato marmalade was funky, it had a pop of flavor that was kinda weird with the fish. The roasted beet sauce added a tang but not a lot of flavor. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dk_Mt1wD7hehq3Iz_iIhkA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nVanilla Creme Brulee- Sweetened with local maple syrup. OMG get this, this was executed perfectly, it is one of the better creme brulees I have had. The custard portion had the right texture and had a very nice mouth feel. Then the sugar top was great, it had a perfect hard outer shell that added a nice texture to the soft custard, it was like eating candy.

I also wanted to note this is an Equadorian restaurant.\n\nI was eating with my son and some friends so we all opted for the tasting menu.\nOur tasting menu consisted of a small salad which consisted of micro green and tomatoes as our first course. The second course was grilled salmon accompanied by corn, carrots, and lobster chowder. The salad was very good but sure enough I found a hot pepper in there. My fault for not telling them I couldn't have foods that burn. The grilled salmon was to die for!! It seemed like just enough for me but wait the third course was coming.\n\nEach time the waiter served us he explained what our dish consisted of.

I went on a weekday night so the restaurant was fairly empty, with only two other parties seated. The waiter was attentive. Ingredients clearly tasted fresh. \n\nThe...eh: \nThey were out of the duck confit and the snapper so we ordered the sea bass, which turned out to be the most flavorful dish, with whatever the green sauce was; butternut quash soup, which was topped with crispy, savory kale chips that offered a nice contrast of flavor to the sweet butternut squash pur\u00e9e; the ratatouille was good, but lacked...something - I won't crave it. For the main, I tried the monk fish which was just not enjoyable. Yes, you can taste the fresh ingredients and the perfectly cooked fish, but it was incredibly boring. It lacked flavor completely as it just had a butter sauce to it. Even the fish could have been lightly salted to bring out natural flavor, but I don't know that it was. Garlic? Bright lemon? Anything? No. It relied heavily on butter...\n\nAll in all, if you are a person who enjoys complex flavors more than anything else in dining, you might want to reconsider this restaurant or you might feel a little remorse when you get the check.

The service is so warm and welcoming I wanted to leave fully satisfied and ready to come back.

Rustic tiny wooden tables, bare decor (although polished), and family-run vibe. You would never think u'd be charged Greenwich Village fares, here.\n\nAfter reading of several yelpers complaining about the amount of food served on the tasting menu, we were cautious on our order, and asked for a couple of appetizers and 1 entree to share. We wanted to test their cuisine before fully committing. \n\nThe pork belly was delicious. 1 small thin piece worth $12, but still very good. \n\nThe Brussels sprouts were tasty, although the portion was also very small... for $10. \n\nUnfortunately, the $23 steak was disappointing. The meat was clearly of low quality, as every piece contained a thick string of tendon right in the middle. It was chewy and difficult to cut. We kept trying and trying with our helpless knives until we left part of it in the dish. Despite the presence of the tendon, the meat wasn't succulent, and surely more rare than medium-rare like we ordered it. Needless to say, it was disappointing. I don't feel it's fair to charge that much for such a low quality cut of meat. After the waitress kindly asked us how we found the steak, I felt compelled to gently let her know what was wrong. She looked sincerely apologetic, but nothing was done to make it better. \n\nOverall, we were glad we were cautious and didn't order more, and eventually finished dinner in a nearby place we trusted.

There's a nice elementary of surprise letting the experts design your meal for the evening -- cause flipping through the menu and deciding what you want is so last season. \n\nOnward to the food -- we started off the meal with a house shot which fires up the belly for all the deliciousness you're about to consume. We had beets with wild greens drizzled with beets vinaigrette -- it tangy and sweet in all the right amounts. The next course we had hand rolled captuni pasta in tomato based sauce -- it was light but it packed with the creamy tomato sauce. Our main course was a mushroom medley with long bean and greens sitting on a bed of quinoa -- this one I had to save half for the next day, it was too good to finish it in one sitting. And lastly the DESSERT -- marinated rhubarb stems with house-made frozen yogurt.

We immediately proceeded to make our worst decision of the night by ordering the chef's tasting menu for two. \n\nIt started off with an appetizer of two corn cakes plated alongside a small nest of pickled cabbage with a quail egg on top. It was tasty but the portion was incredibly small. We were pretty hungry, but we figured the later courses would be more satisfying. \n\nHowever, later dishes were just as paltry. I would equate them to tapas (for which by the way, I highly recommend Salt & Fat in Sunnyside). Aside from the portioning, the food was fairly traditional. At this price point I suppose I expected something a little more creative. If I wanted something traditional, I'd have gone to a more standard place. \n\nI really do appreciate the mission, opening shop in humble Woodside, sourcing local ingredients, etc. Everything tasted great, the steak was cooked perfectly, the service was fantastic. But when it comes down to it, it was a very standard meal. And when we were done paying the ~$130 bill, we had to go down to 74th street and get some $5 momos at a food truck to feel satisfied.\n\nWe did notice that the couple next to us that ordered a la carte (rather than the chef's tasting menu) seemed to get some decently-portioned, tasty looking dishes, and I doubt they had to spend as much as us.

They had a group who sang and played jazz music. Loved that! It does get a little loud so be prepared for that.

The appetizers all look very appetizing, but the way the menu is laid out does not clearly delineate between apps and entrees, probably with purpose. Most recently I got the succotash to start, which was hearty and great to split: a tasty mix of corn, lima beans, and bacon. I followed that up with the duck turnover, which was a solid dish. I appreciated the pineapple and avocado creme sauce that topped the turnover, but the stuffing inside was not particularly remarkable.\n\nMeanwhile, the green pasta with shrimp, which I had previously and hence suggested to my friend upon returning, is phenomenal.

A lightly fried piece of fish with an airy breaking, along with a slice of avocado and a refreshing slaw. There was a good mix of flavors and textures, and I really enjoyed this one. It comes wrapped in a freshly made tortilla (thought there would be 2 for a more authentic touch). Compared to the nasty tortilla at SET L.E.S. (Which I suspect is store bought), this tortilla was much better without that raw flour taste. \n\nThe carnitas was a bit tough, and paled in comparison to the carnitas at chipotle for example. The steak was similarly chewy, and both tacos fell flat for me. If I were to get tacos here again I might just stick to the fish. \n\nThe fries coke topped with a fried egg, some crispy pork belly, and cheese. This is where SET L.E.S. wins. The pork belly here was small chewy pieces, and the fried egg was kinda sad.

Gaijin nails that: friendly chef, good service, great fish, and a feel of community. \n\nWhen we arrived at our reservation at 6:30pm, there were two gentlemen already half way thru their omakase. Apparently they are regulars, which makes the entire place very lively since they joke with everyone. We were presented with a soup with a jumbo shrimp and mushrooms. It was presented in a small tea pot and we \"cook\" the mushroom by shoving it into the tea pot, pour some soup in a tea cup to enjoy, and let it sit for a bit before eating the shrimp and mushroom. Then the sushi begins. My favorite was the fatty tuna with a Maine uni on top. The chef said I looked very happy while eating it. We had about 10 pieces with a tuna handroll. Dessert was red bean ice cream. It is the only good red bean ice cream I have had in the states. It has that sand-y quality, just like those red bean desserts. The cone was crispy and my bf got an extra one with chocolate burbon flavor.\n\nWe ordered some extras at the end since we both thought it was a little small on the portion. I don't eat much and I wasn't full. Another thing is because there is only one sushi chef, depending on the crowd, it could be on the slow side.

The cravings for Omakase were real strong, so I took the 5PM reservation. As we arrived at 5PM on the dot, only one other couple was there for Omakase as well; we basically had the place to ourselves alongside the sushi chef, Mark. The restaurant itself is really narrow yet long. Upon walking in, the sushi bar is in front and there's a few tables in the back for a la carte dining. If you wish to sit at the bar, you may only order the full Omakase. \n\nTo start off the meal, we were each given a soup in a little tea pot with a small bowl to pour it into. In the pot was a shrimp and mushrooms. We were told to tuck all the mushrooms inside, let it cook for approximately 30 seconds, and then to pour the soup into the bowl to drink. This was a really nice way to cleanse your palette before the sushi. \nThe next course was a huge oyster with soy sauce garnished with other herbs and garlic. Boy, I could've eaten at least 5 of these. The oysters were so fresh, they melted in your mouth. All the other garnishes complimented it so well. \nThen, my favorite part: the sashimi. It was roughly 10 pieces, with two hand rolls to conclude. Each piece was so unique, yet hit all of the spots. The fish was fresh and melted in your mouth, and the execution of each piece was just impeccable. My favorite was definitely the toro topped with uni and caviar. The pieces are not \"Manhattan style\" which I loved; in the sense that in the fish to rice ratio, the fish wins. It's a bigger piece of fish over the rice. \nTo conclude, we were given dessert which was gelato from Il Labotorio Gelato, on top of a cone. Always good in my book.\n\nI never think Omakase is gonna completely fill me, but I'm always wrong. It leaves me satisfied, yet not overly full.

He took us to sit in front of Chef Ryan who served our omakase, Chef Mark was serving two other patrons at the moment, but he nodded to greet us. \n\nWe received a wonderful bottle of Junmai from the owner, SK patiently walked us through several ways of sipping/drinking it, we ended up having a few glasses with him and Chef Ryan.\n\nFirst thing first, we started out the tasting menu with a soup, served in a nice stone tea pot, we were told to pour it onto a cup and sip it, after a few pours, we ought to eat the shiitake mushrooms and daikon. It's got a nice rich flavor, different from your typical miso soup, but it was slightly too heavy as a starter. \n\nA typical omakase menu starts with large fish, light to heavier/richer flavors, and ends with sweeter dishes. We had in the order of a yellowtail, salmon, tuna, toro, saba/amber jack kind of fish, sweet clam and eel. Gaijin also follows the rule, but they break it by adding a French kick to it according to Chef Ryan, their head chef studied a little bit of French cuisine, so they incorporate it into sushi, what a brilliant idea! \n\nThe salts, sauces, spices, things like roasted garlic slice, caviar, scallion, all made a huge difference in each piece of sushi, the tuna and salmon were lightly burned by torch fire, we used our fingers to take the sushi and it was a wonderful experience, but each nigiri was very, very delicate, if only the rice would hold up better, it's got a lighter taste (not heavily sweet or vinegar-sour), everything together tasted like one harmony.\n\nThat piece of freshly opened clam was one of the sweetest things I ate, I also loved how the uni and caviar played a game with the toro, the whole thing melted in my mouth, the sardine types of fish were also very different but very good. \n\nI did tease Chef Ryan because he didn't serve tamago at the end, he said he actually made tamago moments ago and offered to us after the anago (which was supposed to be the last course). It was good but more typical than special, I had the custard type at Nakazawa (which he made for 10 years at Jiro's restaurant in Japan) where they would infuse yam in the eggs, but hey, not everyone makes that.\n\nChef Ryan is humber, doesn't talk a lot but was fun to talk to, he'd worked at 15 East before, and also with chefs that came from a Masa background, he has a lot of fun creating omakase, I think what makes a chef a great chef is when they have fun doing what they do, right?\n\nI'll bring my friends in for another tasting and I hope to try something different.", "author": "Weili H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-29", "description": "A delicious splurge it was. \n\nOmakase with Chef Mark was a fun and tasty experience.

The portions.. is.. fair, most of my cup was ice and nothing compares to the LARGE jug of Thai tea from Ayada Thai. We also had the calamari for appetizers which was underwhelming since the batter was not crispy.. it was actually quite soggy even though it was warm and evidently just came out of the kitchen.\n\nMy go-to Thai cuisine, that I get at every restaurant without fail is Pad See Ew.. so I would say I am some type of Pad See Ew expert.. this, was done correctly. The noodles are soft but chewy, flavorful, not too oily, chicken was soft and not rubbery tasting.. and the portion was right.

Best pork sandwich I've ever had. The place itself is super small/ narrow and simple and there isn't seating. They do have counter tops inside and outside to stand and eat though. My bf got the original and I got the box so we can share the fixings that come with the box (it comes with the original, dill pickle, vinegar based slaw, a choice of chips, drink and dessert. Choice of dessert is a brownie, cookie, bacon caramels and hazelnut cookies) We ate right there on the countertop inside so we can have the sandwich while it was hot. I am not lying when I tell you that there were fireworks in my mouth as soon as I took the first bite. The pork is SO beyond juicy, tender and flavorful. The flavors of the pork mix harmoniously with the slightly sweet red onion jam and mustard sauce. Everything just worked SO well and each bite just got better and better. It definitely can get messy if you are not a \"dainty eater\" like my boyfriend likes to call himself. I, on the other hand, had sauce running down my hands- do not worry, they have wet naps to clean yourself up with. The slaw and pickle was refreshing to eat with the loaded meat sandwich and the chips gave the perfect crunch. Nothing beats the combination of a sandwich and chips. This sandwich by the way is full of meat and a hefty portion but I would not get the smaller size, its just THAT good. However, I was beyond stuffed at the end. But not stuffed enough to try my dessert. I opted for the hazelnut cookies which were so decadent and chocolately. My type of dessert.

Man, these folks are way too clean to be eating Rocket Pig. (Rocket Pig)\n\nI walk into this tiny tiny space. I see the counterperson and ask him do I order first and then eat over there? He said, yeah grab a table. Great! I walk into the garden party and ask for a menu. The menu doesn't reflect Rocket Pig.

The cole slaw was served in a separate container, it had a vinegary taste that cut the fatty BBQ meat. It worked well together.\n\nThe drink choices were limited, Sprite, diet Coke and Pellegrino Limonite, I chose the sparkling Limonite.\n\nNorth Fork chips - BBQ or Sweet Potato. I chose SP\n\nFinally desserts. I was so looking forward to the bacon caramel, sold out. As a matter of fact, the counter person said I had the last Ciabatta bun??

I mistook it for Trestle on Tenth many a time, which is right on the corner; the entrance to Rocket Pig is on 24th Street and leads into a very narrow shop - enough space for a few standing spots at a countertop along the side. With exposed brick everywhere, it does feel like a literal hole in the wall, although there is outdoor seating you can park yourself at, weather permitting. The menu is pretty straightforward - the sandwiches are the star of the show (with the salad being the other main of note), with a number of sides. We both went with the sandwich and soup combo, which we figured (correctly) would leave us adequately filled, and we grabbed a brownie to snack on while waiting for the sandwiches.\n\nThere's no question that the sandwiches are excellent, and the bread is fantastic to boot. The pork is really juicy and succulent - there's a reason you get a wet wipe with the sandwich - and the picked mustard and aioli really round out what is a very aromatic, flavorful, and decadent sandwich. The bread is worth noting; despite being crispy, it doesn't scratch the roof of your mouth like you might expect, and the texture is a nice complement to the tenderness of the brined pork. The soup is pretty straightforward as well, and it's lighter than I would have guessed, based on how rich the pork meat in the sandwich was. With a heavily smoke-infused flavor, it's pretty much pork broth at its purest, with a few veggies and some bits of pork meat added in. It's a tad on the salty side, but it's quite refreshing next to the sandwich. The brownie was pretty standard-issue, although I did like the subtle hint of espresso that it had without overpowering the chocolate in the brownie. It was a little dried out, but given it was lighter on the butter, that was not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nEven though it does not look like much on the outside, Rocket Pig is definitely worth a stop.

A friend invited me to a spot that her best friend co-managed and I wasn't even very hungry nor did I want to spend much money (I'd gladly come back and give them all of my money).  Where do I begin? I was privileged enough to meet the chef as there is an open kitchen located towards the front of the restaurant. Passerbys can look in (and creepily take pictures from the street) at the chef and his small staff hard at work preparing greatness. There's front window countertop style seating, and then a lightly generous amount of seating for at least one decent sized group and a smaller one of individual date night type situations.\n\nThe food is amazing!  I (heavily) sampled like 5 different dishes and they were all equally amazing with no exaggeration. The names are hard to remember but I took photos of each and got the name right in the pictures so peruse them at the bottom of this review. A standout was the mushroom appetizer with the fried egg. It was the best thing I'd eaten all month and i typically don't like mushrooms and I was so reluctant to try it. I'd go back just for it.  The pasta is perfectly made.

The interior is small and quaint, one of the nicer, newer and semi upscale restaurants on the block with plenty of natural light coming in from their all window store front. Inside seats probably around 20 and a few stool seats against the window.

It turned out to be a good amount, I was full but not overly stuffed.\n\nMy friend had the fetuccine carbonara, asparagus, crispy pancetta with an egg yolk.

Alas, though Nicandra's fit the bill on the latter, it was quite affordable!\n\nI called Friday afternoon for an 8:30 PM reservation, and Charmaine put me down. As it turns out, Charmaine works the whole house:  She sat us when we came in, and then served us the entire meal. She was extremely kind and personable.\n\nWe started with the burrata and the glazed pork ribs. The burrata was excellent, freshly kneaded and atop a bed of tiny, cool fresh greens.

The pappardelle was the freshest pasta I've had in some time. The raisins made my girlfriend, upon discovery, squeal with the delight. The sweetness and texture paired so well with this dish. The gnudi was excellent, too -- similar to what you might think of as a 'gnocchi', and topped with a huge portion of braised oxtail. Filling and delicious. We just passed our bowls back and forth throughout the meal like savages. \n\nBYOB. At the lady's request, I'd brought along a bottle of \"Sav B\", which paired nicely with our choices.

The only part worth mentioning is the spicy honey inside the sandwich. It went very well with the chicken.\n\nI also tried their 8 Oz hanger steak with herb butter.

I judge brunch places by their eggs benedict and I must say, this place does an excellent job!\n\nI would come to this place every weekend if I could however, the street parking around is sometimes difficult but that's not anything the restaurant can control.", "author": "Ruby L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-11", "description": "We had a delightful meal at C\u00f4t\u00e9 Soleil and felt so at home here -- this is a lovely family establishment and the proprietors treat everyone with such warmth. I really felt like we were being treated to a meal in a friend's cottage in Provence.\n\nThe food is classically French and well-executed; there are lots of classic French culinary school dishes on the menu, and portions are generous. I noticed vegetarians and children eating here, and the clientele was pretty diverse: a nice reflection of the neighborhood, and there's something for everyone here. It's the kind of place where I'd gladly take out of town guests or parents, though it is rather on the small side.\n\nWe tried the escargots, p\u00e2t\u00e9, coq au vin, and salmon -- and got an extra basket of bread so sop up all the amazing sauces. Everything was super, and I especially enjoyed our appetizers. The herb butter surrounding each little snail was packed with so much flavor and I probably clogged up my arteries sponging all the leftover butter with the slices of baguette we had. The p\u00e2t\u00e9, which I believe is homemade, had a nice spice profile and bits of pistachio, very country-style. The entrees were warm, comforting, and well-sauced, and everything was plated unfussily but appealingly.\n\nMost importantly, the staff was unfailingly gracious, kind, and attentive -- you can tell that they really care about this restaurant and have invested in this neighborhood.

I heard about the opening a few months back and decided to take a friend here and I have to admit, I was really impressed with the place. It is such a neighborhood gem, I could really see myself coming here once a week and they also have a really kick ass Sun-Thurs deal for an app and entree for $19.10, there are 4 options for apps and 4 options for dinner. The one thing, the restaurant is on the small side and the tables are kinda mushed together, and not that it matters but having a French waitress was a nice touch. Fun fact, the name means sunny side in French.\n\nThe food:\n\nLe P\u00e2t\u00e9 Maison- Homemade country pate served with gherkins, mustard and bread. This was super homey and comforting, the texture wasn't as smooth as I would expect a pate to be but the flavor was great and I loved the bits of the pistachio. I felt this had more of a consistency of like a sausage pattie, but still a great starter. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4n9_csOzgwtQlHdEhtYVPA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nLa Soupe \u00e0 L'oignon Gratin\u00e9e- French onion soup gratin\u00e9e. I thought the French onion soup was really good, I loved how it was not too salty since I typically find it to be overly salty. I loved the chewy stringy cheese, it had a really nice consistency but I did wish the broth was a bit more pronounced, the broth could have been a little more beefy. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gLiWxGVPhRy3i6NlEx1Iiw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nLa Terrine de Foie Gras- Home made duck foie gras with toasted bread and jam. I am a big foie guy and I really enjoyed the terrine. The flavor of the foie was very pronounced and I enjoyed the creamy texture and the crunch from the bread, the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the jam which I think was apricot. It was too aggressive and overwhelmed the flavor of the foie instead of complement it. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IX-iiQWy6Ck7X7znv9hXpQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nLes Escargots au Beurre Persill\u00e9- 6 Snails with garlic butter. I really liked the pronounced garlic flavor in the oil and you should dip the table side bread into the oil, but the snails themselves were just OK, not too much going on but that oil was excellent. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Wj19CxXrS7Yl6p78zm3G7Q&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nLe Cabillaud au Champagne et Pommes de Terre Nouvelles- Pan seared codfish w/ Champagne sauce and roasted fingerling potatoes. This is their best entree, the cod was so perfectly cooked, it was so nice and flaky but that champange sauce was excellent! The sauce tied everything together perfectly. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=UxDudTgwZrp6Gjk35olPZQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nLe Saumon \u00e0 L'oseille et ses \u00e9pinards- Filet of salmon served with rice, spinach and sorrel sauce. I thought this dish packed so much flavor. I really enjoyed the salmon, the spinach and the sorrel sauce, everything made sense together. I did find the salmon to be more cooked than I would have preferred but the dish is one to order. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=z5dS_pIeKnTQa0f7qlEYug&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nLe Coq Au Vin- Chicken braised in red wine with mushrooms, pearl onions, carrots and potatoes. This screams Winter to me, the Coq Au Vin was so rich and comforting. The flavor was great, I really loved the depth of the sauce and the root vegetables from the pearl onions to the carrots to the potatoes. I thought the chicken was nice and tender but it was a bit overcooked and a tad dry for me. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=myYeXMnMPpjhsU_rHP5YdA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nLe Boeuf Bourguignon- Slowly braised beef in red wine sauce with mushrooms and bacon, served with mashed potatoes. The beef was so tender and the texture was great, I did wish there was a tad more fat in the beef to give it a little more silkiness. The mash was such a great pairing, it really worked well together but sadly the mash ran out before the beef did, wish there was more mash. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=m6-E4fPu1QM2qbJP8NYBWA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nLa Bavette \u00e0 L'\u00e9chalote- Flap steak served with potatoes and salad w/ green peppercorn sauce. This was my first time having flap steak and it was just OK to me, it was kinda like a chewier version of skirt steak. The green pepper sauce had nice flavor but had such a weird look to it, it looked like liquid cheese that tightened up. The one thing I did love were the fries, the fries were excellent, they had a nice potato flavor with a really nice crunch. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7nTFFe25S_erwUzoxiJYfg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\n\nLa Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e- The Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e was good, the layer of sugar on on top had great texture, the custard was so nice and velvety, this is a must get. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XOcmlFAI2DCfU9LHnuUxtA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA", "author": "Ben L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-08", "description": "What a lovely addition to the neighborhood!

The salad was even good with a little bit of dressing. \n\nNext was the French Toast. I got to say I never really  had French french toast until today. It was very fluffy inside and a crispy on the outside soo good. And the strawberries and Nutella made it complete. \n\nLast but not least The Baguez.

Good thing too because shortly after the line with all the beautiful, young people (with money my poor 20something son added) trailed out the door. \n\nBefore I get to the food, let me just say this place had ambience, complete with mosaic tiles in the bathroom. Mirrors, china and a lovely bar as the centerpiece. I seem to recall a patio in back too but could be mistaken. The staff was by far some the most young professionals in service I have encountered. They were friendly and respectful even though it was clear we were not part of the beautiful set nor did we have cute Williamsburg babies in tow. \n\nSo, the food. I will let the pictures speak for themselves but the sides of home fries were crispy and fresh. We each had an egg dish. I loved mine which included a semi-spicy tomato Moroccan sauce.

There are only a few large tables and the seating is pretty tight in the main area so if you're uncomfortable being close to others or have a large group you may want to call ahead to see what is available. There is also a lovely garden area in the back where you can sit and eat but it was closed for renovations when we visited.\n\nAs far as our first-hand experience with Moroccan cuisine goes, this spot certainly delivered on flavor and diversity.

I walked into a warm and dimly lit restaurant that was in full swing. The brisk cold air outside was instantly gone as I walked in. Since they don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday nights I just put the hostess on notice that I had a party of 4. It was around 7:30 and she gave me an estimate of 50 mins. The actual wait was more like 40 minutes so we were happy about that.\n\nWe shared the following Appetizers : Greek salad, hummus and babaganoush with bread that reminded me of naan bread. The bread and hummus was really nice and fresh and together were my favorite appetizers. The Greek salad was a little less enticing. Although Greek salad is my favorite I didn't like that the feta cheese was not broken down and there were less tomatoes than usual but there was something else missing from the flavor but the side salad made up for it.\n\nEntree : My ladies had the chicken grill and mixed grill. These dishes came with a side salad. I had a smaller appetite and had the garlic shrimp appetizer with a side salad and extra olives. My side salad was much better than the Greek salad. The greens were nicely chopped and the olives were a nice compliment.\n\nFor my beverage I had the Mango Martini which was solid! For round two I had a glass of Pino Noir. \n\nFor dessert we shared the Almond Cake which is gluten free for the birthday girl!\n\nLast but not least I need to talk about the customer service. Cafe Mogador gets five stars for their attentive nature. My water glass was always filled. The dirty plates were methodically removed from our table.

I got the Middle Eastern Eggs with poached eggs, which came with hummus, tabouli, arabic salad and zahatar pita. Everything on my plate was delicious. The zahatar pita tasted pretty authentic. It reminded me of the food I had when I was in Jordan years ago. The hummus was flavorful and creamy.  The tabouli and arabic salad were fresh and tangy, a great balance of flavors to the humus and pita. \n\nMy friends got the Blackstone Eggs, Moroccan Eggs, and Chicken Grill and they all loved it.

I saw the birthday celebration thingy on some yelp reviews and decided to come here for my friend's birthday.

For appetizers, we had their ham croquettes and plantain chips along with the flattened bread they serve you. The ham croquettes in my opinion was maybe the worse croquettes ever. They were shaped like a breakfast sausage link and tasted ZERO ham. I even had to ask the waiter if this was the ham croquettes and even he acknowledged there was ham in there. Perhaps they blended it or something because there was no hints of ham in that croquette whatsoever. And the way it was deep fried, the batch of oil they used must have no been changed all day or they overcooked it. The plantain chips however were nice. Light golden color and crispy. The flattened bread was unique. I kinda wish it was toasted a little bit longer just it would be a bit toastier and easier for the butter to melt.\n\nFor our main course, we kept it simple. We ordered the paella once we sat down because it takes up to an hour to cook. It well worth the wait. I've had my fair share of paella in my life and this would easily rank somewhere in my top 3. It's $51.99 to start with, so that kinda threw me off guard because according to their website menu, it's listed at $41.99. So expect $10 dollars more. They should consider updating their website and menu prices. But the paella, it was unbelievably good. It had seafood, chorizo, and chicken. They weren't stingy with the ingredients either. There was plenty of scallops, lobster, and shrimps. It was served nice and hot, straight out of the pot. It was so good and so hard to believe that this was suppose to be a serving size for two. My son loved it!\n\nWe enjoyed the evening with sangria and I tried a bottle of their Cuban style ale. The bottle of ale was $7. I asked for something from Cuba, but its produced in USA. I was hoping for a actual Cuban cerveza. The sangria was delightful and refreshing. As far as the service goes, I think it could be better. We went on a weekday, it was really empty compared to the weekends here. Much of staff were chatting in the back or at the bar. We felt a little ignored at times. They didn't serve us the flattened bread until one of the main waiters or host noticed it roughly 15-20 minutes after we sat down. But all of the waiters were friendly. \n\nI would certainly love to come back for the paella. The biggest downside to dining at Rincon Criollo, they only accept American Express! For me, that's just a huge blow. Master/Visa is pretty much standard everywhere else and this spot is acting like the old Costco with their AMEX only policy. I mean even Costco now is accepting Master, Visa. For reward purposes, I really dislike the fact that they don't accept any other card except for AMEX.

The Ropa Veija was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth, it was just too salty. We also had the tres leches and I was not really impressed. For $5 for a slice, I could barely even split it with my friend.  We also ordered \"sangria.\" Do NOT get sangria here. The server went behind the bar got a slice of orange and cherry garnish and put it in the bottom of the glass and poured wine on top. That is not sangria my friend.\n\nIn sum, whoever cooked on Friday night was very heavy handed on the adobo. The portions were on the smaller side for the prices we paid approx. $16 for ropa vieja.

Those grilled onions just added an extra oomph. \n- Ropa Vieja ($15.95): shredded beef in tomato sauce, thought this was a bit salty but flavor was good and beef was tender. \n- Rabo Encendido ($15.95): oxtail served in a stew-like sauce.

My coworker told me that there is a scarcity of good Cuban food in Queens. She's from Florida, so she knows. So we met a co worker and her hubby here to try good Cuban food, for a weekend lunch.\n\nWe ordered 2 apps, and 4 entrees (includes 8 sides- 2 sides per entr\u00e9e), to share family-style. We devoured thinly sliced chorizos, Cuban tamal, ropa vieja (shredded beef in tomato sauce), oxtails, roast pork, and liver with peppers. We wolfed down black beans, fried sweet plantains, fried potatoes, yuca with garlic sauce and fried plantains. After all that, we still had leftovers. K had a refreshingly cold passion fruit drink. \n\nMy favorites: \nIf you love garlic, you have to get the yucca with garlic sauce. Soft, starchy cassava boiled to a soft sweet-potato-consistency with this sweet savory garlic sauce. So good! I've never had yucca like that before! \n\nThe shredded beef with tomato sauce was so good! Tender fall-apart-under-your-fork juicy beef in a sweet homemade red sauce. Yum! Everyone loved this dish.\n\nThe oxtails was wonderful! Stewed soft cartilaginous oxtail in an tomato-spiced stew. I wish I had ordered two of these. \n\nThe roasted pork looked dry but wasn't.

I felt like I was sitting in a royal Thai Palace! Needless to say, they went ham on the decoration and it is absolutely beautiful. It's  a great place for you to bring a date! \n\nI've heard many good things about this place and I have been itching to try it out for months!! Overall the food is pretty good and each plate is decorated and presented beautifully; the chefs here really take the time to make these dishes look \"instagrammable\" LOL. The menu is so extensive! It literally has so many options you can choose from; I felt a little dizzy just looking at my options. Tip: if you cannot handle spices ask your waitress or waiter house by see the dish will be because I have heard from other people that some of these dishes are really spicy. \n\nAs for the overall service experience, I thought the staff was really helpful. My hostess knew the menu inside and out and was glad to point out to me which dishes may be too spicy for me to handle. I have to say that service was a little slow, it took us forever to receive our food and I got really anxious at one point because people who came in after us got their food before we did. Anyway, onward to the dishes:\n\n1) Lychee Thai Tea ($4)- It was delicious! Not too overly sweet. It also looked fancy as hell but I think $4 is a little bit overpriced. I would order it again anyways because I honestly was in love with it \n\n2) Kao Tang Na Tung appetizer ($12)-  Least favorite dish of the day. It sounds really fancy on the menu but I didn't think it was that good. Definitely would not pay $12 to eat this again. Basically it had mince shrimps, minced crab meat, minced pork, shallot, coconut milk and lemon grass; all of the above ingredients were basically puree into a paste which they put on a rice cracker. It looked good but it tasted okay. I couldn't discern what the heck was in the paste at all. \n\n3) papaya Salad ($9)- Love how they used fresh papaya! Each bite was so crunchy! It also came with pork rinds which is one of my guilty pleasures. Also it was not too spicy, which I really appreciated. The downside to this was that it was way way too salty/sour, which I attributed to WAY TOO MUCH chili lime dressing. It would have been better if they didn't drown the salad in the sauce. They also used a lot of fish sauce in the dressing so it made it super salty; I was gulping down water with each bite. \n\n4) Royal Pad Thai ($18)- This was what I had came for! I saw all the positive reviews about this dish and how fancy it looks; my verdict is that it tastes just as good as it looks. The presentation was so beautiful! The pad thai was wrapped around an egg net (so creative right?), there was bean sprouts on the side; it also came with 4 huge prawns, perfectly cooked I might add. It sat on top of a single banana flower petal, which I would suggest you not eating LOL. I enjoyed every single bite of this plate, it was so delicious and definitely tasted a whole lot better than the typical pad thais I was used to eating. \n\n5) Green Curry - it came with heart of palm, thai eggplant, pineapple, basil leaves, coconut milk and I believe a meat of your choice. I also thought this dish was really good; it was not my main course but that of a friend of mine so I only took a bite or two to sample. I thought the spice level was just right and it tasted fresh and homey! It went beautifully with the jasmine rice. \n\nSO in conclusion, I would love to come back here, not just for the food but to just enjoy the atmosphere!

However, the reason why I took away one star is because every dish was a bit on the salty side in our opinion. You'll definitely need extra rice to wash it down.

However, I wasn't too hyped to try this place because I could've just gone to the elmhurst/woodside area for cheap authentic Thai food. But what the heck, I felt bougie that day after finishing my finals. We went there for lunch on a weekday and the place was pretty packed when we went but luckily got a table immediately. \n\nThe food was more like a 3/5 stars, but with the fancy decor and attentive service (the servers all wore traditional Thai clothing!) I bumped it to a 4. \n\nKha Nom Boung Youen ($19): in the past, I've only really had the street food kha nom Boung which is more like a light, sweet snack. So it was very interesting to try a savory version of kha nom boung. The crepe shell was made of egg and was very crispy. The filling contained a myriad of super fresh seafood (so so good) and you pour on the cucumber relish. For me, the relish was a bit too sweet... like the first few bites I thought the dish was amazing but towards the end I was chugging my water. I guess my advice would be to DRIZZLE on the cucumber relish to your liking. \n\nLunch special\nChicken Tom Yum Fried Rice ($13- price varies with choice of meat): the lunch special comes with a choice of soup/salad and listed appetizer. We opted for the salad and chives pancakes. They were both very small portioned and honestly I wish they stuck with just one thing and given more of it.

The pork is so good!! \n\nDrink: the classic Thai iced tea - sweeter than ever and not too creamy.\n\nAppetizer: Ray Rai Nah Phu - You can eat the leaf...hahaha. This is made to be eaten in one bite, and it tastes delicious, although I suggest eating it without the leaf anyway to get a better taste of the meat + curry. The curry is more sweet than it is spicy! \n\nEntrees: crab fried rice and stuffed seafood crispy egg crepe - I order the same thing at every Thai restaurant: fried rice or Pad Thai. It tastes the same everywhere. Yet I was not disappointed by Thai Villa's crab fried rice; I don't know what it is, but the rice tastes more flavorful. Kudos for the attempt at molding it into a dome. The stuffed seafood crispy egg crepe is even better, although the seafood most likely tastes better than usual wrapped in the egg and dipped in the relish. 4/5 for both dishes! \n\nDessert: mango sticky rice - Our waitress told us that this is the best choice on the menu, but to me it's a mere 3/5. I don't like the idea of mixing rice with fruit...hard to get anything down after a few minutes. The blue coloring doesn't make it any more appealing. I don't know what else is good for dessert, but don't get this if you're not into this mix either.\n\nOverall, a positive experience.

The Cavatelli was as expected; the pesto was tasty & the pasta was cooked very well.\n\nFor the entrees, I got the Grilled Shrimp & Carrot Stew and my husband got the Lasagna. The stew had a different kind of flavor & the broth was the most enjoyable part. I didn't realize there was going to be any fish in it along with the shrimp so that was a nice surprise! My husband enjoyed the lasagna and it was pretty flavorful but it was a bit on the heavy side.\n\nOverall, a very pleasant meal & the service was spot on! The kitchen paced the meal well and our server helped us by making good recommendations. We'd definitely suggest checking out Gramercy Tavern for a fancy dinner night out.", "author": "Rashmi G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-19", "description": "Owned by Danny Meyer and often considered by various publications to be among the best restaurants in the city, Gramercy Tavern is legendary in the NYC dining world. It's where Tom Colicchio made his name, and although I'm a hair less attracted to him than I am to Padma Lakshmi, I'm a big fan of that Top Chef. The kitchen is now run by Tom's successor, Michael Anthony (remarkable consistency in only having two chefs during a lengthy run in such a transient city and industry). \n\nI've been hearing about this restaurant my entire life, and combining that with many stars from many critics, I must say I probably came in with almost unreasonably high expectations for my first visit. These expectations were met in various ways, and unfortunately not in others. \n\nThings That Made Me Believe The Hype:\n\nThe squash tortellini with arugula, bone marrow, and crispy gremolata. This was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. It was head and shoulders above the rest of the tasting menu (and obviously better than everything on the vegetarian tasting menu that my wife opted for). \n\nThe service. It was relaxed, but impeccable. I'm pretty sure the hordes of fine people scurrying around the dining room in uniform would've brought us anything we asked for. \"You want a toe? Hell, I can get you a toe by 3 o'clock this afternoon. WITH nail polish.\" \n\n(I also appreciate that this excellent service is included in your meal. It really makes a massive difference when you spring for a meal like this, because 25% of a million dollars is...a lot of money. I'm not good at math.)\n\nThe lagniappe. From the perfect bread and goat cheese butter you start with to the coffee and caramel petit fours at the end of the meal, not to mention the chocolate granola bar you are sent on your way with, and the beautiful dessert with a chocolate inscription they sent out for my wife's birthday...this is a restaurant that knows the vast majority of us can only afford to do this on a special occasion. And they treat you accordingly.\n\nThings That Made Me Flavor Flav:*\n\nThe marinated sea scallops with blood orange, fennel, and pumpkin seeds. Although it was gorgeous to look at, the scallops were under-seasoned and dare I say it, downright slimy. This was also the first dish of the tasting menu, and such a disappointment. It wasn't the only flaw in the food, but luckily nothing else was as off. That said, it was a sad way to start a meal I had been looking forward to for years. If they were just trying to temper my expectations, it worked. \n\nEverything else we ate fell much closer to the squash tortellini than the scallops, but the meal overall wasn't quite the perfection I had envisioned. I realize that my expectations were probably unfairly lofty, but that's what prices and a reputation like this get you.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPlease believe me when I tell you that this is still an incredible restaurant. It is impossible to have a bad time here. Between the majority of the food, the service, and the people-watching, you have to hate deliciousness and fun and having your every whim catered to if you walk out of this restaurant in a bad mood. \n\nBut I think I'm going to eat in the Tavern next time, because I can't afford to drop this much money on those scallops.\n_____________\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vQaVIoEjOM", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-08", "description": "Review for the off-menu burger only. Will update when I return for a full meal!\n\nOverall (5 stars): The off-menu burger is a gift bestowed upon us. The meat falls apart in your mouth and the smoky flavor of the cheese and bacon complement the thick patty marvelously. The bun is somehow perfectly studded with sesame seeds throughout and toasted so that the outside is crispy but the bun itself still maintains chewiness. The chipotle aioli adds even more spice and smoky flavor to the burger. \n\nGeneral: Upon stepping inside of Gramercy Tavern, one can feel that this is a world-renowned establishment. We arrived early before the restaurant opened on a Saturday afternoon, though I feel that we still would've gotten a seat if we arrived a little later. Service here is impeccable, from the time it takes to order drinks, order food, receive food, have all your plates cleared away at once, etc. You really receive top-notch treatment here. \n\nFood: I'm unsure if this is still true but I heard Gramercy Tavern only produces a limited number of these burgers each day. The restaurant grinds ribeye, filet, and other trims of the cow freshly each day. The wood-fire grill they use to smoke and grill the patty and bacon imparts that amazingly smoky flavor to the burger. The meat itself is so incredibly juicy and melts/falls apart in your mouth. The chipotle aioli and pickled fresno chiles are wonderful toppings to the burger for that extra kick of spice. Everything works together to deliver you one amazing burger experience.

We had to wait 15 minutes even with a reservation.   The dining area is beautifully decorated.  \n\nThe menu is simple, for dinner, it has a 3-course menu for about $125.  The dishes change seasonally.  \n\nWe had the beef carpaccio and squid ink campanelle (squid ink pasta) as the first course.  The squid ink pasta was very tasty, it had bits of lobster, chorizo mixed in the sauce.  The beef carpaccio went well with the garnishes - peach and arugula leaves.  The appetizers were the best part of the meal. \n\nFor entree, we both ordered the duck breast with sausage, the portion size was very small and honestly, the sausage didn't go well with the duck breast.  The combination was very strange.  The duck tasted okay but the meat was not tender.  I had better duck elsewhere. \n\nOne thing to note, their rolls are very good. They are flaky and buttery, I believe they are called Angel biscuits/rolls. \n\nFor desserts, we had the raspberry and chocolate desserts.  The raspberry dessert is a coconut milk cake, topped with apricot sorbet and raspberry.  The chocolate dessert has milk crisps, lavender and hazelnut brittles.  The ingredients, etc. are listed on the menu which would help the selection process.  \n\nFor special occasions, they would present your table with a small cake on the house.  There was a couple sitting next to us, celebrating their wedding anniversary.  They were given glasses of champagne and a cake.  Great personal touches there.  \n\nAt the conclusion of your visit, your server would give you some goodies from their bakery to take home, we were given 2 homemade granola bars.  \n\nOverall, I think the food at Gramercy Tavern is average.  Their menu also seems to carry very basic American dishes.  The taste of the food is not very tantalizing.   Their dining room is also very loud.

I eat a ton of authentic tacos and these were not it, I was not expecting these to be authentic but I was also not expecting them to cook the shit out of them. Where's the flavor?

I got the passionfruit, which flavor wise was pretty on point. It was a tad bit weak, but I'll live. \nWhite sangria ($8) also pretty good, but I'd go for the mojito over the sangria. \n\nGuacamole ($10): the tortilla chips were heavily doused in sea salt which made it overwhelmingly salty, but it's easily brushed off. Honestly, nothing too special but a good decent to share with a group of friends\n\nTacos (3 for $12): personally I didn't like the shell because of it's soft, non-chewy texture but maybe that's just me. The assortment of meats were overcooked to the point where the guac and pico de gallo couldn't save the dryness.\n\nSkirt steak lollipops ($12): it looks like a lot but there's really only 4 skewers hidden in the mixed green and pesto(?). The steak was very well seasoned, slightly over cooked, but it was still pretty good.\n\nAlcove fries: the saving grace of it all. Truffle, cheese, bacon piled onto the crispiest fries you could ever imagine. The moment your server places it down, you'll be hit with the amazing aroma and it will very quickly inhaled by everyone. The one and only downside was the sprinkle of cheese was not enough to hold the bacon and fries together so after finishing the fries you kinda have a sad pile of bacon bits. \n\nWill I come back?

It is a gorgeous space, pretty large, with great decor.  It rivals Thai Villa as the nicest looking Thai restaurant in Manhattan.\n\nThe lunch specials are a pretty good deal; $10 for a soup or salar, appetizer, and entree, with some additional cost if you get a fancier meat in your dish, such as duck.\n\nThere were five of us, and we ordered a total of four lunches.  Four our appetizers, we got to try the soup and the salad, and had a mix of steamed dumplings, which are filled with chicken and shrimp, and net rolls, which are filled with crab and shrimp.  The soup had a really light and good flavor and, even though small, had a lot of tofu in it, which was nice.  The salad was pretty standard; it had the usual ginger dressing on it and was tasty, but nothing special.  The net roll has a crispy outside and has a good amount of shrimp and crab; it was a good choice.  I didn't get to try the steamed dumplings, but my friends seemed to like them. Overall, with the exception of the net rolls, the lunch appetizers are pretty much your standard Thai lunch appetizer offerings.\n\nFor entrees, my friends had pad thai and moo dang.  I got to try the pad thai, and it was good, but nothing too special.  My fiance had been to Up Thai for lunch previously and she told me that the pad thai was larger and had more sauce and was tastier her first time there.  Perhaps they were having a bad day this weekend?  I had the pra ram with fried squid.  The squid was cooked really well and wasn't chewy at all.  And there was sufficient vegetables in it.  The peanut sauce was really good and slightly sweet.  My only complaint is that the dish was so small.\n\nBased on this one experience, I would say that Up Thai is a solid but not-so-special Thai restaurant.  It's lunch offerings are pretty standard, as are the prices, and the portions were somewhat small.

We started off with drinks, all of which were fine - nothing special. The food, however, was pretty fantastic.

And the restaurant was 75% empty at 5:15. The hostess asked us if we could leave by 6:30...which frankly is really rushed. It took 20-25 minutes after we placed our order around 5:25-5:30 for all the food to finish coming out, which doesn't give you much time to finish it. I had to negotiate with the restaurant to stay until 6:45, and I suppose I should be thankful they didn't ask us to physically leave until 7pm. I understand that they have a lot of customers, but it's one thing if there is a line out the door and a large group is sitting around after their meal chit-chatting and making the wait longer for everyone else.

The place was surprisingly packed for a weeknight at 8 pm, but luckily there was an available table for us. \n\nAs expected, the food is fantastic. Up Thai generally serves classic dishes that I recognized, but there were also some soups and other items that seemed a bit more obscure. I was so tempted to try the pad see ew (my favorite Thai dish and usual go-to) but ultimately opted for the chicken pad krapow (Thai chili, string beans, onion, bell pepper and basil leaves), which is served with jasmine rice. It was excellent: somewhat spicy, but not overpoweringly so. It also tastes a little sweet, I suppose because of the basil and bell pepper. The veggies are obviously all super fresh.\n\nMy dining companion had the cod with pineapple curry (red curry paste, pineapple, asparagus, onion, bell pepper). I'm a little allergic to cod, so I only had a bite of pineapple with the curry sauce, but I can tell I would've loved the curry. It had a very nice coconut-milky flavor to it. \n\nI also tried an \"ultimate\" Thai iced tea, a tea spiked with vodka.

We went absolutely overboard and I'm so glad we did because it gave us a chance to really see how skilled their chefs are. \n\nWe started with the pork belly appetizer and their Half Baked mac n cheese. The pork belly was delicious, not as liquid-tender as some places I'm used to but still a good option on the menu. It comes with their original BBQ sauce and their habanero sauce. The mac n cheese however is some of the BEST I've ever had. It's got Jack cheese, bacon bits, and beef chili. The beef chili really takes it over the edge, this is some damn tasty chili. The spices are just right, and it's just the right amount so it doesn't overpower the cheesy goodness.Not that it needs the extra oompf, but I found adding some of their original BBQ sauce to the mix put the entire dish into overdrive. Their sauce is perfectly balanced, not too sweet, with a hint of smokiness. ALL THE FLAVORS. \n\nMy partner ordered the meat platter (ribs, pulled pork, brisket) with the burnt ends or \"meat candy\" added on. It also came with cole slaw, pickles, and a biscuit. This is a generous, filling portion of food. While all the items are fantastic, the stars of the show were absolutely the ribs and the meat candy. In both instances, the flesh was beyond melt in your mouth tender, with the perfect amount of silky fat in each bite. Dipping the meat candy into the habanero sauce is a must. The original BBQ sauce goes great on the ribs, which I can't talk up enough, and I'm picky about ribs. They're good with or without sauce. \n\nI ordered their beef burger with pulled pork, Muenster cheese, and slaw. Slather some of that BBQ sauce on there, and this thing is daaaaamn good. It was also cooked a perfect medium rare.\n\nThe apple cake is sticky sweet. Their moonshine mimosas are massive. The Blood Moon cocktail has a serious kick from the habaneros. They have a great moonshine selection, including watermelon, blueberry, and apple. They also have pickle backs! \n\nOur waitress Lindsay brought the whole experience full circle.

It was seasoned deliciously and the corn had a grilled taste without the burns. \n\nMeat candy: also known as their award winning meat. These are the burnt ends served with three types of sauces. Be careful though. You might get addicted. \n\nPork belly: the portion looks small but two orders plus other things for a party of 12 were just enough. The juice melts out of the pork belly fat and then in your mouth. I liked this dish but preferred the three above over it.  \n\nGuacamole and chips: your standard but still delicious guacamole with puffed up tortilla chips. It's a good one to share amongst a few. \n\nAs for the entrees, most of us just got the barbecue platter to share among two people.

Their drinks are out of this world amazing. We had the \nThe Butcher's Punch: I think this is my favorite drinks so far on the money. \n Georgia Creamsicle: this is made with moonshine so if you're a bit nervous to try first time I would say to start with this drink\nBees & Honey: This is the first time I've enjoyed a cocktail made with mezcal. It literally balances the mezcal perfectly and they use raw honey which is soooo good.\nFor starters we shared the wings and the chili cheese nachos. The wings were fried to perfection and the sauce that they used was really good. I loved the flavor of the chili with the nachos. We literally inhaled our food! \nFor the main course, I had burnt ends aka meat candy and a side of mac n cheese. The only regret I had was ordering the quarter pound instead of half or even 1 lb because it was THAT GOOD. Also, last but not least THE CREW. The staff there are so chill; they literally embody what LES use to be. By the end of the night, we were chatting it up with the bartenders and hostess. They're not pretentious or overbearing which is a plus.\nNo doubt, I'll be back for the meat candy and I definitely want to try the other items on the menu. P.S....this is the place to try moonshine (go for the blueberry flavor and thank me later.)", "author": "Natasha P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-16", "description": "The food was delicious and the hospitality was good..I will back with my coworkers..loved the smokey BBQ flavor as well as the sweet and spicy sauce", "author": "Sharon B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-14", "description": "Absolutely amazing! The vibe from this place was extraordinary and gave a very good LES feel. The food was phenomenal. Burnt ends or \"Meat Candy\" was some of the best we've ever had. Mac n Cheese Starter with chili was delicious and big enough for two. The Buttermilk Pan Fried chicken sandwich was outstanding. Conor, the GM, gave great drink recommendations that were out of this world. Me and the fianc\u00e9 came here for our two year anniversary and Matt the owner was super generous. We can't thank him enough. Alex, our server was awesome. Always near by and provided great recommendations.

To my knowledge, it might be the only BBQ spot in the area, and they have prime real estate in LES with all of the traffic in the area.\n\nI suggest that you get the Bees and Honey, which is a mezcal and honey cocktail that's absolutely one of the best drinks ever....they also had moonshine, which was pretty good and had some kick to it.\n\nFor starters, we kept it standard with chicken wings and nachos. Really good. For main course, I opted for the pulled chicken sandwich, which was pretty good and came with fries. My friends and I split a mac and cheese. This was pretty much the only downside of what we had since the M&C wasn't baked with cheese. It was pretty much noodles and cheese sauce.\n\nThe staff was also friendly. They had these cool t-shirts inspired by The Infamous Mobb Deep, a nice touch.\n\nOverall, i'd recommend this place.

The Meat Candy was melt in your mouth tender and came out within minutes of ordering (pro tip: eat it simultaneously with the pickles they put on the side, it's a game changer). As for entrees, even though the menu is considerably smaller than their Astoria location, there are still some prime choices. I got the BBQ chicken sandwich with a side salad and my boyfriend got the Monster 50/50, which is a half prime rib, half brisket burger. Both were phenomenal and, again, came out in a decent amount of time. The drink menu is also pretty good, and the waitstaff actually knows their stuff when you ask them for a recommendation.\n\nThe only downside is that there's one waitress for the whole establishment, which backed up our check as we were trying to leave. Once they nail down their computer software, though, I'll be back for more.", "author": "Emily C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-14", "description": "After waiting for over a year to try the Butcher Bar in queens , one popped up at this more convenient location.   After much deliberation we went with the Fried chicken sandwich and the smoked BBQ burger and the smoked and fried wings as an appetizer . \n\nThe wings were perfect and some of the best I ever had with the sweet and spicy sauce we opted for . \nThe smoked BBQ burger was a tad bit salty, likely from the brisket addition . It had a good taste to it despite the saltiness.\nThe chicken sandwich was less than memorable . The breading and marinade wasn't as pronounced as I would have liked . It was just bland and had very little flavor for a fried chicken sandwich . Not even a request of a coleslaw topping could save it honestly . \n\nThis place has a lot of offerings and a large drink menu so I'll try more options and update along the way .", "author": "Kern C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-31", "description": "A friend and I were roaming the streets of the LES when we passed this place. It was a slow Saturday night and the hostess was outside inviting people to come in and check out this new establishment. She told us about the special - a Miller High Life and a shot of Moonshine for $3 - and we were sold! \n\nIt was a nice set up and it was a good number of people there, but not too crowded and rowdy. So the atmosphere was very pleasant. We didn't get food (although we did try some of the bacon-I don't even think that's on the menu), we only had the drinks. I'll def be back to try it though, especially the burnt ends. Those look amazing! \n\nOh, and we met one of the owners and his wife. They were so nice and cool! We even went back the very next day to get the special again.

WOW!!! They just melt in you're mouth there amazing. It does taste like candy. \nWe had the shrimp with grits as a main meal was also was full of taste.

It has many seats and is a good place for groups. The service is very good. It got quite noisy as more and more people came in.\n\nMeat candy (burnt ends): my favorite among all the dishes we ordered. The meat was tender and flavorful. Since the size in the starter was small, I guess it would be better to add it to the smoked BBQ platter (+$5). 4.5/5\n\nFried pickles & jalapenos: the flavors of pickles and jalapenos were covered by bread crumbs, but the spicy sauce for this dish was a big plus. 3.5/5\n\nSmoked BBQ platter: It includes pulled pork, brisket, ribs, slaw, pickled cucumber, and cornbread w/ honey-butter. I wish they added more sauce on the pulled pork, which was good. The brisket was on the dry side. The ribs in this platter were similar to Fall off the Bone Ribs.
